# Message Generator Demo

## Description
**Message Generator Demo** is a simple Node.js command-line program that generates random inspirational quotes, including the owner's name and a reflection for the user. The primary goal of this project is to inspire and motivate users through daily messages. It was built to practice working with arrays, randomization, and basic Node.js scripting.

The project solves the problem of needing quick, positive daily motivation by automating the process of generating an uplifting message with every run of the program. This simple tool can be used as a daily dose of positivity or incorporated into larger applications.

**Motivation**: This project is part of my Codecademy portfolio where Iâ€™m practicing JavaScript syntax. It allowed me to work with arrays, random number generation, and build a simple Node.js application. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in implementing the core concepts of JavaScript while also enhancing my Node.js skills.

## Features
- **Random Inspirational Quotes**: A new motivational quote is generated each time the script is run.
- **Matching Owner Information**: Each quote is paired with the name of the author.
- **Reflection**: After the quote, a short reflection or takeaway message is provided.
- **Easy-to-Use**: Just run a simple command to get a random, positive message.

#### Example Output:
ðŸ’¬ "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."  
â€” Franklin D. Roosevelt  
ðŸ§  Reflection: Face your fears today.
